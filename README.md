# Tools for Responsible AI ðŸ‘¾

ðŸš© Developing artificial intelligence tools with accountability is everyone's responsibility.
There are more and more tools available to gain insight into your data and  help you become more aware of its inherent biases.

In this repo you can find my runthrough of the [FairLearn quickstart](https://fairlearn.org/v0.11/quickstart.html) including my notes.

There are many other tools available so I encourage you to take a look (and reach out to me if you find interesting ones!).

Find the article detailing what Responsible AI is and how to use these tools in [this article on my website](https://meganbloemsma.com/blog/tools-for-responsible-ai).
